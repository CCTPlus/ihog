# iHog

This is where all or most of the feature code is. Following [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) guidelines of being modular, it was decided to put features into their own library.

## Libraries

Each library is a feature or a reusable piece of the app.

### Analytics

An easy and consistent way to use analytics in the app

### Components

Reusable components all through out the app

### iHog

The main store of the the whole app.

### Utilities

Other useful functions and property wrappers that are built out to help make life easier.
